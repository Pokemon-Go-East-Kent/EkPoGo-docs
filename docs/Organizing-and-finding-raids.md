# Organizing and finding raids FAQ

## How do I report a raid?
Find the relevant channel for the area. This will be #margate, #westgate-birch, or #ramsgate. Then type `!r` followed by the number of minutes on the timer, and either the egg level (1-5) or the name of the pok?mon if it has hatched. For example, if you see a level 5 egg hatching in 45 minutes at Thanet Colts, you would type `!r 45 5 thanet colts`.

## I reported a raid with the wrong time, how do I correct it?
Use `!raid hatch <minutes> <gym>` or `!raid despawn <minutes> <gym>` for example, if the raid on thanet colts hatches in 15 minutes, you would type `!raid hatch 15 colts`.

## I reported a raid with the wrong pokemon or egg level, how do I correct it?
Use `!raid pokemon <egg level or pokemon name> <gym>` for example, if the raid on thanet colts is actually Tyranitar, you would type `!raid pokemon tyranitar thanet colts`

## How do a find out where a gym is?
You can either click on the gym title at the top of a raid announcement, or type `!gym find <name of gym>`. For example, `!gym find thanet colts`

## How do I let others know I am going to a raid?
Press the thumbs up button below the raid announcement, you'll be added to the list of trainers going to the raid. When you arrive, refer to the list of going users to check if everyone has arrived. If you have multiple phones or you're bringing someone with you who isn't signed up to Discord, you can use the +Person button to let others know.
